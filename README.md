Developed with the skills I learnt at the bootcamp by the end of first week of coding boot camp experience at Columbia University, NY. Date of publication: 9/28/2020.

This website is designed exclusively using the CSS bootstrap and incorporates responsive design attributes. 

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

# Note to user
The code shared in this repository demonstrates how you can creat dynamic websites while integrating responsive design features that are compatible across a broad spectrum of devices and web-browsers. Notice that Bootstrap is essentially a compilation of CSS code that simplifies the styling of websites using pre-packged code in the form of CSS classes improving efficiency. For example, the design of navigation bar, footer and forms using bootstrp classes leads to consistency in web-design without compromsing customisability and while maintaining flexibility across a variety of devices ranging from desktop to a smartphone with a small screen. The CSS files containing the code for classes are located at the local CDN (content delivery network) and can be linked into HTML.
